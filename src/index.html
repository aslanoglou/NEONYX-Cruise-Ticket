                discovered, law enforcement will be immediately
                notified. Consequently, Neonyx Cruises will be

                <p>The Company is accountable for demonstrating compliance with the GDPR’s six principles of processing
                    personal data.
                    These provide that personal data must be:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject
                        (‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’)
                    </li>
                    <li>Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner
                        that is incompatible with
                        those purposes (purpose limitation)
                    </li>
                    <li>Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they
                        are processed (data minimization)
                    </li>
                    <li>Accurate and, where necessary kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure
                        that personal data that
                        are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or
                        rectified without delay;
                        (accuracy)
                    </li>
                    <li>Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for
                        the purpose for which the
                        personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the
                        personal data will be
                        processed solely for archiving, historical research or statistical purposes subject to
                        implementation of the appropriate
                        technical and organizational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and
                        freedoms of the data
                        subject; (storage limitation)
                    </li>
                    <li>Processed in a manner to ensure appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
                        against unauthorized or
                        unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate
                        technical or organizational

                <h5 class="h5 text-primary mb-0">5. LAWFUL, FAIR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESSING</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The GDPR is not intended to prevent the processing of personal data, but to ensure that it is
                        done fairly, transparently and
                        without adversely aecting the rights of the data subject.
                    </li>
                    <li>For personal data to be processed lawfully, they must be processed on the basis of one of the
                        legal grounds set out in the
                        GDPR. These include, among others:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the data subject's consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes;</li>
                            <li>that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the data

                <ul>
                    <li>In the course of the Company’s business, the Company may collect and process the personal data
                        set out in the Schedule.
                        This may include data the Company receives directly from a data subject (for example, by
                        completing forms or by
                        corresponding with the Company by mail, phone, email or otherwise) and data the Company receives
                        from other sources
                        (including, for example, business partners, sub- contractors in technical, payment and delivery
                        services, credit reference
                        agencies).

                    <li>The Company will only process personal data for the specific purposes set out in the Schedule or
                        for any other purposes
                        specifically permitted by the GDPR. Should the Company need to process the personal data for
                        another purpose than
                        those set out above, then it will promptly notify the data subject. If the Company processes
                        personal data on other legal
                        grounds than consent or on the basis of EU law or the laws of an EU Member State then the
                        Company will first ascertain
                        whether the new purpose is compatible with the initial purpose, the reasons for processing, the
                        nature of the personal
                        data and the possible consequences for the data subject.

                    </li>
                    <li>whether the Company uses the personal data to undertake any automated decision making</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the Company receives personal data about a data subject from other sources, it will provide the
                    data subject with this
                    information within a reasonable period of time
                </p>
                <p>The Company will also inform data subjects whose personal data the Company processes that the Company
                    is the data
                    controller with regard to that data, and who the Data Protection Ocer is.</p>

                <h5 class="h5 text-primary mb-0">8. ADEQUATE, RELEVANT AND LIMITED TO WHAT IS NECESSARY</h5>
                <p>The Company will only collect personal data to the extent that it is required for the specific
                    purpose notified to the data
                    subject and kept only as long as is necessary.</p>

                <h5 class="h5 text-primary mb-0">9. ACCURATE DATA</h5>
                <p>The Company will ensure that personal data it holds is accurate and kept up to date. It will check
                    the accuracy of any

                    reasonable steps to rectify or
                    erase any inaccurate or out-of-date data without delay.</p>

                <h5 class="h5 text-primary mb-0">10. LIMITATION ON STORAGE</h5>
                <p>The Company will not keep personal data in a form which permits identification of data subjects
                    longer than is necessary for
                    the purpose or purposes for which they were collected. It will take all reasonable steps to destroy,
                    or erase, from its
                    systems, all data which is no longer required.</p>

                <h5 class="h5 text-primary mb-0">11. PROCESSING IN LINE WITH DATA SUBJECT'S RIGHTS</h5>

                <h5 class="h5 text-primary mb-0">12. DATA SECURITY</h5>
                <p>The Company will take appropriate security measures against unlawful or unauthorized processing of
                    personal data, and
                    against the accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data.</p>
                <p>The Company will put in place procedures and technologies to maintain the security of all personal
                    data from the point of
                    collection to the point of destruction or erasure. Personal data will only be transferred to a data
                    processor if they agree to
                    comply with those procedures and policies, or if they put in place adequate measures themselves.</p>

                <h5 class="h5 text-primary mb-0">The Company will maintain data security by protecting the
                    condentiality, integrity and availability of
                    personal data, dened as follows:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confidentiality means that only people who are authorized to use the data can access it.</li>
                    <li>Integrity means that personal data should be accurate and suitable for the purpose for which it
                        is processed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Availability means ensuring that personal data is protected against undesirable destruction or
                        loss and that authorized
                        users should be able to access the data if they need it for authorized purposes. Personal data
                        should therefore be stored
                        on the Company’s central computer system instead of individual PCs.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h5 class="h5 text-primary mb-0">Security procedures include:</h5>

                        reported and prevented from
                        gaining access to systems where personal data are processed.
                    </li>
                    <li> Input controls. Data users’ activities should be logged enabling the subsequent establishment
                        of whether and by whom
                        Personal Data have been entered, modified or removed from the Company’s data processing systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>Access controls. Personal data should be prevented from being read, copied, modified, removed or
                        exported to other
                        devices or formats by unauthorized persons. Data users entitled to access certain personal data
                        should only be able to
                        access the data they need and are authorized to do so.
                    </li>
                    <li> Secure lockable desks and cupboards. All desks and cupboards should be kept locked if they hold
                        confidential
                        information of any kind. (Personal information is always considered confidential.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Methods of disposal. Paper documents should be shredded. Digital storage devices should be
                        physically destroyed when
                        they are no longer required.
                    </li>
                    <li>Equipment. Data users must ensure that individual monitors do not show confidential information
                        to passers-by and that
                        they log o from their PC when it is left unattended.
